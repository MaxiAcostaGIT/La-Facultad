Welcome to my first JAVA project! I am a student at "UTN" university and this is a practical work for Laboratory II. In this prototype of a "University Manager" we will be able to perform different operations such as creating universities, editing their careers and more. This project was created using the Intellij IDE and the Java programming language.

### ‚ùó Important:
When we start the program, it will start with some elements to get an example of how it works:

- if we choose to add a student, we are going to need to especifc the name, last name and the file number.
- if we choose to delete a student, it will show us the list of students of the course, once we choose one it will be deleted from de system.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Salir:
This option will exit the program.

### üõ† Some Advices:
- There's no Try/Catch, so if we enter an incorrect data it will show us an error.
- There's a function named "eliminarEstudiante()" in the C_Materia class. But it's not implemented in the Main. This is because we choose to work in that way.
- For the moment there is not a .jar file, so it's only work in the compiler.

# üí° Credits:
This program was made by "Acosta Maximiliano Nicolas" for the course "Laboratory II" of the career of "Technician University in Programming" of the "National University of Technology".
